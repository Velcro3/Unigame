                Unigame is a game launcher, designed with WinUI 3 to intergrate seamlessly with your existing games. Think Steam, Epic, EA, and if you're a developer, any launcher you want!
                Unigame is open source, and wouldn't be possible without the devs kind enough to help fix bugs, add features, and test the app.
                It was only possible thanks to other launchers, like Playnite and Lutris, which inspired the design and functionality of Unigame.
